### Thoughts

* Will get kinda expensive to print out lots of copies two times every semester.
At least for our budget. We can think of other ways to spread this info/paper.


### TODO's

* Get feedback on first edition from students
* Collect links and tips from previous students
* Create second edition for 2018 spring courses (One version for each program if needed)


### Edition 1
Around 60 copies was given to NV and ST students.
