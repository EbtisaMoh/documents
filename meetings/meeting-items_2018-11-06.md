## COMMON BOARD ISSUES
### Lunch lectures & teacher events
- Improving topics list - we need your help: documents/ideas/lunch-lecture_topics.md

### Helping out - Big Data Conference
So far For both days of the big data conference (29th and 30th of November) 5 ppl from the board helping out:
29.11.: Cheab, Hannah Louise, Cris, Julia, Yuri
30.11.: BB, Lucian, Annie, Marcus, Yuri
--> if we organize 6-8 people each day we only have to help out half day! (shift-wise)

### Career Day Technology on the 15th of November!

### Still people needed for meeting in Stockholm about a master's degree in software technology
